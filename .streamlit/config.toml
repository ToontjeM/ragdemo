# List of locations where secrets are searched. Entries can be a path to
# toml file or directory path where Kubernetes style secrets will be
# scanned. Order is important, import is first to last, so secrets in later
# files will take precedence over earlier ones.

# Default: [ <path to local environment's secrets.toml file>, <path to project's secrets.toml file>,]
